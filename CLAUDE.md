# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Balados Sync is a CQRS/Event Sourcing system for synchronizing podcast listens, subscriptions, and playlists. The project was originally generated by Claude.AI following instructions in `ORIGINAL_NOTE.md`. This is an Elixir umbrella application using Commanded for CQRS/ES and EventStore for event persistence.

## Architecture

This is an umbrella application with four main apps:

### balados_sync_core (Domain/CQRS/ES)
- **Commands**: User intentions (Subscribe, RecordPlay, ChangePrivacy, etc.)
- **Events**: Immutable events (UserSubscribed, PlayRecorded, PrivacyChanged, etc.)
- **Aggregates**: Business logic encapsulated in `User` aggregate
- **Dispatcher**: Command routing using Commanded
- All commands are routed to the `User` aggregate identified by `user_id`
- The aggregate maintains state for subscriptions, play_statuses, playlists, and privacy settings

### balados_sync_projections (Read Models)
- **Schemas**: PostgreSQL tables for read models (subscriptions, play_statuses, playlists, podcast_popularity, episode_popularity)
- **Projectors**: Event handlers that update read models
- Three schemas: `users` (user data), `site` (public data), `events` (EventStore-managed)
- Uses Ecto for database interactions

### balados_sync_web (REST API)
- **Controllers**: HTTP endpoints for sync, subscriptions, play status, episodes, privacy, RSS proxy, and public data
- Subdomain routing: `play.balados.sync` for play gateway (tracks listens and redirects to enclosures)
- Phoenix-based REST API with JWT authentication (RS256)

### balados_sync_jobs (Background Workers)
- **SnapshotWorker**: Runs every 5 minutes to:
  - Create checkpoints for users with events >45 days old
  - Recalculate popularity scores (subscribe=10, play=5, save/like=3, share=2 points)
  - Clean up events >31 days old after checkpointing

## Development Commands

## Key Architectural Patterns

### CQRS/Event Sourcing Flow
1. **Command** arrives via HTTP (e.g., POST /api/v1/subscriptions)
2. **Controller** extracts JWT, creates Command struct
3. **Dispatcher** routes Command to User aggregate by `user_id`
4. **Aggregate** validates and returns Event(s)
5. **EventStore** persists immutable Event
6. **Projectors** listen to Events and update read models
7. **Controller** queries projections and returns response

### Adding New Commands/Events
When adding new functionality, follow this pattern:

1. Create Command struct in `apps/balados_sync_core/lib/balados_sync_core/commands/`
2. Create Event struct in `apps/balados_sync_core/lib/balados_sync_core/events/`
3. Add `execute/2` handler in `User` aggregate that validates and returns Event
4. Add `apply/2` handler in `User` aggregate to update aggregate state
5. Register Command in `Dispatcher.Router`
6. Create/update Projector to handle Event and update read models
7. Add controller action if HTTP endpoint needed

### Aggregate State Management
The `User` aggregate maintains state through event sourcing:
- State is rebuilt by replaying all events for a user
- `execute/2` functions decide what events to emit (based on commands)
- `apply/2` functions update aggregate state (based on events)
- State includes: subscriptions, play_statuses, playlists, privacy settings

### Data Encoding
- RSS feed URLs are base64-encoded as `rss_source_feed`
- Episode identifiers are base64-encoded as `rss_source_item` (format: `"#{guid},#{enclosure_url}"`)
- JWT tokens use RS256 signing with public/private key pairs

### Privacy System
Three levels: `public` (visible with user_id), `anonymous` (visible without user_id), `private` (hidden)
- Configurable globally per user
- Can override per podcast feed
- Can override per individual episode
- Privacy changes update the `site.public_events` projection

### Checkpoint and Cleanup System
The SnapshotWorker performs maintenance every 5 minutes:
1. Finds events older than 45 days
2. Creates `UserCheckpoint` events with current aggregate state
3. Checkpoints are upserted into projections (considered source of truth)
4. Recalculates popularity scores from `site.public_events`
5. Deletes events older than 31 days (after checkpoint)

### Sync Strategy
The `/api/v1/sync` endpoint compares client state with server state:
- **Subscriptions**: Takes most recent timestamp (subscribed_at vs unsubscribed_at)
- **Play statuses**: Takes most recent `updated_at`
- **Playlists**: TODO (needs added/removed dates)
- Emits individual events for each diff
- Creates checkpoint after sync completes

## Testing Patterns

### Dispatching Commands in Tests
```elixir
alias BaladosSyncCore.Dispatcher
alias BaladosSyncCore.Commands.Subscribe

Dispatcher.dispatch(%Subscribe{
  user_id: "user_123",
  device_id: "device_456",
  device_name: "iPhone",
  rss_source_feed: "base64_encoded_feed",
  rss_source_id: "podcast_id"
})
```

### Querying Projections in Tests
```elixir
alias BaladosSyncProjections.Repo
alias BaladosSyncProjections.Schemas.Subscription

Repo.all(Subscription)
Repo.get_by(Subscription, user_id: "user_123")
```

## Configuration Notes

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection for projections
- `EVENT_STORE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection for EventStore
- `SECRET_KEY_BASE`: Phoenix secret key
- `PHX_HOST`: Production hostname
- `PORT`: HTTP port (default 4000)

### App Authorization System

The app authorization system uses OAuth-style JWT authentication with RS256 signing.

#### Token Tables
- **app_tokens**: Third-party app authorizations (JWT-based)
- **play_tokens**: Simple bearer tokens for play gateway

#### Authorization Flow

1. **App creates authorization JWT** containing:
   - `iss`: App ID (mandatory, unique identifier)
   - `app`: Object with name, url, image, public_key
   - `scopes`: Array of requested permissions (e.g., ["user.subscriptions.read"])

2. **User authorizes** via `/authorize?token=...`
   - System validates JWT using embedded public key
   - Shows app details and requested scopes
   - User approves or denies

3. **App makes API requests** using JWTs signed with private key:
   - `iss`: App ID (identifies the app)
   - `sub`: User ID
   - Must be signed with private key matching stored public key

#### Scope System

Hierarchical permissions with wildcard support:

**Base Scopes**:
- `*`: Full access
- `*.read`: Read access to all data
- `*.write`: Write access to all data

**User Scopes**:
- `user`: Full user profile access
- `user.read`: Read user profile
- `user.write`: Update user profile
- `user.subscriptions`: Full subscription access
- `user.subscriptions.read`: List subscriptions
- `user.subscriptions.write`: Add/remove subscriptions
- `user.plays`: Full play status access
- `user.plays.read`: Read positions
- `user.plays.write`: Update positions
- `user.playlists`: Full playlist access
- `user.playlists.read`: List playlists
- `user.playlists.write`: Manage playlists
- `user.privacy`: Full privacy access
- `user.privacy.read`: View privacy settings
- `user.privacy.write`: Update privacy settings
- `user.sync`: Full sync access

**Wildcard Patterns**:
- `*.read`: Matches any read scope
- `user.*`: Matches all user scopes
- `user.*.read`: Matches all user read scopes

#### Example Authorization JWT

```json
{
  "iss": "com.example.podcast-player",
  "app": {
    "name": "My Podcast App",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "image": "https://example.com/icon.png",
    "public_key": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n..."
  },
  "scopes": ["user.subscriptions.read", "user.plays.write"],
  "iat": 1234567890,
  "exp": 1234567890
}
```

#### Example API Request JWT

```json
{
  "iss": "com.example.podcast-player",
  "sub": "user_123",
  "iat": 1234567890,
  "exp": 1234567890
}
```

#### Scope Validation in Controllers

Controllers use the `JWTAuth` plug with scope requirements:

```elixir
# Require specific scope
plug JWTAuth, [scopes: ["user.subscriptions.read"]] when action in [:index]

# Require multiple scopes (all must be granted)
plug JWTAuth, [scopes: ["user.read", "user.subscriptions.read"]]

# Require any of several scopes
plug JWTAuth, [scopes_any: ["user.sync", "user"]]
```

#### Image Visibility

App images are only displayed if ≥10% of users have authorized the app.
- If <1%: Shows "~30 users" (rounded to nearest 10)
- If ≥1%: Shows "15% of users" (rounded up)

#### Key Files

- `apps/balados_sync_web/lib/balados_sync_web/app_auth.ex`: Authorization logic
- `apps/balados_sync_web/lib/balados_sync_web/scopes.ex`: Scope definitions and matching
- `apps/balados_sync_web/lib/balados_sync_web/plugs/jwt_auth.ex`: JWT validation plug
- `apps/balados_sync_projections/lib/balados_sync_projections/schemas/app_token.ex`: App authorization schema
- `apps/balados_sync_projections/lib/balados_sync_projections/schemas/play_token.ex`: Simple token schema

### Subdomain Configuration
For local testing with `play.balados.sync` subdomain:
1. Add to `/etc/hosts`: `127.0.0.1 balados.sync play.balados.sync`
2. Configure in `config/dev.exs`:
```elixir
config :balados_sync_web, BaladosSyncWeb.Endpoint,
  url: [host: "balados.sync", port: 4000],
  http: [ip: {127, 0, 0, 1}, port: 4000]

config :balados_sync_web,
  play_domain: "play.balados.sync"
```

## Common Gotchas

- **Event Store vs Projections DB**: Never manually modify the EventStore schema. Only interact through Commanded APIs.
- **Replaying Events**: If projections get out of sync, reset the projection database with `mix ecto.reset` and projectors will automatically replay all events.
- **Immutability**: Events are immutable. To "delete" data, emit new events (like PrivacyChanged or EventsRemoved).
- **Aggregate Consistency**: Always dispatch commands through the Dispatcher to ensure proper event sourcing.
- **Testing Event Store**: The EventStore requires a separate database for tests. Ensure proper test configuration.
- **Snapshot Command**: The `CreateCheckpoint` command should only be called by the SnapshotWorker, not manually.

## Useful IEx Commands

```elixir
# Check aggregate state
alias BaladosSyncCore.Dispatcher
Dispatcher.aggregate_state(BaladosSyncCore.Aggregates.User, "user_123")

# Query event stream
alias BaladosSyncCore.EventStore
EventStore.read_stream_forward("user-user_123")

# Check projector state
BaladosSyncProjections.Projectors.SubscriptionProjector.state()
```
